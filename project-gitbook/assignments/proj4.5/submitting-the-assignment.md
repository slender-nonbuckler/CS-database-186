### Gradescope

Once all of your files are prepared in your repo you can submit to Gradescope through GitHub the same way you did for [Project 0](notion://www.notion.so/project/assignments/proj0/submitting#pushing-changes-to-github-classroom).

### Submitting via upload

If your GitHub account has access to many repos, the Gradescope UI might time out while trying to load which repos you have available. If this is the case for you, you can submit your code directly using via upload. You can zip up your source code with `python3 zip.py --assignment projQOcomp` and submit that directly to the autograder.
